## Caesar Cipher Hacker
# Description
The Caesar Cipher Hacker is a Python script that can decrypt messages encrypted with the Caesar cipher through a brute force attack. It tries every possible key to decrypt the message and outputs the decrypted text for each key.

# Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Run the caesar_cipher_hacker.py script.
Enter the encrypted message when prompted.
The script will display the decrypted message for each possible key.

# Advanced Features
Multi-threading: Implement multi-threading to parallelize the brute force attack and speed up decryption.
User Interface: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the tool more user-friendly.
Optimize Key Search: Use frequency analysis or other techniques to prioritize potential keys and improve decryption efficiency.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to handle unexpected inputs and edge cases gracefully.
Unit Testing: Write unit tests to ensure the correctness of the decryption algorithm and handle edge cases.

# Contribution Guidelines
